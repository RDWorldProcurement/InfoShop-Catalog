**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack e-commerce platform with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. It features a redesigned UI with Infosys BPM branding, a multi-language interface powered by Emergent LLM for deep translation, and a catalog populated with thousands of products and services with CDN-hosted images. Key features include user authentication, a product/service catalog with search and pagination, a detailed order history page with 5 distinct statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Processing, Shipped, Delivered), and an InfoCoins rewards page. A fully functional Admin Portal has been created, allowing for vendor catalog uploads. All previously reported image loading issues have been resolved.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Addressing a multi-part user request to prepare the app for deployment. The agent started by scraping product data from Donaldson, Avantor, and Markem-Imaje websites and generating corresponding images. The next steps were to add these products to the backend, fix UI alignment issues on the catalog page (specifically the Add to Cart button), add Admin login credentials to the login page's side panel, and improve the visibility of the Infosys BPM logo.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **P1 - Core Features:**
    *   Implement Schedule Repeat Orders feature (connect backend logic to ).
    *   Implement Bulk Submission via Excel (connect backend logic to ).
*   **P2 - Chatbot:** Enhance the InfoConnect chatbot placeholder with actual conversational capabilities using Emergent LLM.
*   **P2 - UI/UX:** Add icons for category names in the catalog.
*   **P2 - Automation:** Implement a cron job or background task that periodically fetches new products from partner APIs (Grainger, etc.).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Catalog & Order Expansion:**
  - Expanded product and service catalogs to support 3+ pages of content.
  - Enhanced the Order Management page to show 5 distinct statuses (, , , , ) with a visual timeline.
- **Data Accuracy & Enrichment:**
  - Replaced all generic/mismatched product images with specific, Emergent-generated CDN images.
  - Added new Digital Marketing services to the service catalog.
  - Updated InfoCoins rewards with correctly matched, Emergent-generated images.
- **Admin Portal Creation:**
  - Built a complete, secure Admin Portal () for uploading vendor catalogs. It includes a dashboard, an upload form with vendor/file type selection, and summary tabs.
- **Deep Language Translation:**
  - Integrated Emergent LLM to provide real-time, deep translation for product/service names and descriptions.
  - Implemented a MongoDB-based caching system for translations to improve performance.
- **UI & Stat Updates:**
  - Updated the landing page stats to reflect 78 MRO Categories and 511+ Global Brands.
  - Added an Admin link to the main navigation.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. A syntax error introduced by a  command was identified and fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - Issue recurrence in previous fork: Product/service images not loading.
  - Recurrence count: 3+
  - Status: RESOLVED
  Note: The underlying issue of using unreliable external image URLs was definitively solved by switching to Emergent's CDN. The user's new requests are about the *accuracy* of the images relative to descriptions, not about them failing to load.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB ().
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, , TailwindCSS.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Internationalization (i18n):** React Context with a static translation file for UI chrome and a dynamic, LLM-based translation service for catalog data.
- **Translation:** Emergent LLM via  library, with a MongoDB cache ( collection).
- **Image Handling:** All images are generated via  and hosted on an internal CDN.

**key DB schema**
  - **users:** {id, email, name, country}
  - **products:** {id, name, description, brand, category, ...}
  - **services:** {id, name, description, category, ...}
  - **orders:** {id, user_id, items, status, order_date, ...}
  - **translations_cache:** {cache_key, translated_text, language, timestamp}

**changes in tech stack**
- **Emergent LLM Integration:** Added  library to leverage LLM for deep language translation of dynamic content.

**All files of reference**
- : Heavily modified to add more products/services, 5 order statuses, an admin upload endpoint (), updated stats, and an LLM-powered translation endpoint with caching. JWT expiration was increased.
- : New file created for the admin catalog upload feature.
- : Updated to include the route for .
- : Updated to display new stats (78 categories, 511+ brands) and add an Admin link in the navigation.
- : Rewritten to display a 5-stage order status timeline and fetch data from the enhanced backend endpoint.
- : Updated to pass the selected language to the API and re-fetch data on language change.
- : Reviewed to understand state management for language selection.
- : Updated to reflect completed tasks and new requirements.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None.

**key api endpoints**
- : Updated to accept an optional  query parameter for translation.
- : Updated to accept an optional  query parameter for translation.
- : Updated to return new counts for categories and brands.
- : Updated to return 5 distinct order statuses and detailed tracking info.
- : **New** endpoint to handle vendor catalog file uploads.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Deployment Readiness:** The user considers these next fixes as the final step before deployment. Pay close attention to UI polish, data accuracy, and overall application stability.
- **Admin Portal:** An admin portal now exists at . The backend endpoint  is set up, but the file parsing logic for different vendor formats (Grainger, Fastenal, etc.) is likely a mock and will need implementation.
- **LLM Translation:** The translation feature is live and uses the  environment variable. It translates product/service data on-the-fly and caches results in the  MongoDB collection.
- **Image Accuracy:** This is a recurring user concern. Ensure all new products (Donaldson, Avantor, etc.) have images that very closely match their descriptions. The  should be used with descriptive prompts.
