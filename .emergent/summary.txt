<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to merge two applications, OMNISupply.io and infosys-ai-desk.preview.emergentagent.com, into a single, unified platform under the OMNISupply.io brand.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
*   **Unified Landing Page:** Redesign the OMNISupply.io landing page to incorporate the business offerings and content from the Infosys AI Desk, presenting three core user actions:
    1.  Browse Catalogs (existing OMNISupply.io feature).
    2.  Upload Quotation for AI-powered analysis (from Infosys AI Desk).
    3.  Request End-to-End Sourcing Support (from Infosys AI Desk).
*   **Feature Integration:** Integrate the Upload Quotation and Sourcing Support features as new, fully functional pages within OMNISupply.io.
*   **Backend Implementation:** Create new backend endpoints for the integrated features. These should be fully functional, with mocked but realistic AI analysis, and persist all data (requests, user info, history) to MongoDB.
*   **Authentication:** The new Upload Quotation and Sourcing Support features must require user login.
*   **Branding:** Ensure 100% branding alignment with Infosys BPM. Use a unique, AI-generated logo for OMNISupply.io and specific ERP vendor logos.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Clarify button/page labels (e.g., Sourcing Support to Managed Services / Buying Desk).
    *   Add a PO and Invoice Handling Entity selection to procurement flows.
    *   Implement a Buying Desk Dashboard to track the status of managed sourcing requests.
    *   Ensure full multi-language support on the landing page for all 5 languages (English, French, German, Italian, Dutch).
    *   Update the value proposition text on the landing page to be more compelling and transformational.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a unified procurement platform, OMNISupply.io. It integrates catalog browsing with AI-powered quotation analysis (One-Off Purchases) and managed procurement (Managed Services / Buying Desk). A new Buying Desk Dashboard has been implemented to track sourcing requests through various stages. The UI has been significantly updated with a new AI-generated logo for OMNISupply.io, logos for ERP partners and ProPay.ai, and revised labeling for clarity. A language selector has been added to the landing page, and the translation files have been updated for five languages. However, the landing page itself is not fully translated, with several sections still displaying hardcoded English text.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of fixing a recurring bug where the landing page would not fully translate when switching languages. The agent correctly identified that numerous text elements were hardcoded in English. After updating the translation files () with all the necessary keys for all five languages, the agent started editing  to replace the hardcoded strings with the  translation function. This work is incomplete.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? frontend testing agent. After the fix, the agent should take full-page screenshots for all 5 languages (English, French, German, Italian, Dutch) to verify that every single text element on the landing page is correctly translated.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  Landing page multi-language support is incomplete and broken (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description:** When the user changes the language on the landing page, large sections of the page remain in English. This includes the navigation links (Features, How It Works), stats cards (Annual Spend Managed), AI feature descriptions, and more. This provides a broken user experience.
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent correctly identified the root cause: hardcoded English strings in . The agent successfully populated  with all the required translation keys for all 5 supported languages. The agent then started updating  but only managed to translate the main navigation links before the session ended.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
        - Continue editing .
        - Systematically replace all remaining hardcoded English text with the corresponding translation keys from  using the  function.
        - **Sections to fix**:
            - Feature lists inside the main CTA cards (e.g., Multi-brand comparison).
            - The stats section (Annual Spend Managed, Enterprise Clients, etc.).
            - The How It Works / AI Intelligence section titles and descriptions.
            - The ERP integrations section title and subtitle.
            - The final call-to-action section (Ready to transform your procurement?).
            - The footer links.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To provide a seamless and professional multi-language experience as requested by the user, ensuring the entire landing page is usable for non-English speakers.
     - **Status**:  IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** Y (This is the second attempt to fix the translation comprehensively).
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Complete the translation of the Landing Page (P0)
 
 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - **Where to resume**: The file  is open for edits. The agent has just finished updating the navigation links (around line 240). The next step is to continue down the file, find the next hardcoded section (the feature list inside the CTA cards, around line 370), and replace it with , etc.
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully internationalized landing page where all text content changes dynamically based on the selected language.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **P1 - Real-time Notifications:** Implement email or in-app notifications to alert users when their Buying Desk request status changes (e.g., from RFQ Sent to Quotes Received).
*   **P2 - Admin View for Buying Desk:** Create a new page/dashboard for admins to view, manage, and update the status of all user-submitted Buying Desk requests.
*   **P2 - InfoConnect Chatbot:** Integrate a real LLM into the InfoConnect chatbot placeholder to provide conversational support.
*   **P2 - DB Query Optimization:** Address the minor performance warning from the deployment health check by refactoring two queries in  (lines 3084, 3090) to use more efficient MongoDB aggregation pipelines instead of .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **DB Query Optimization**: Two queries in  (lines 3084, 3090) use a blanket . These should be refactored to use more efficient aggregation pipelines for better performance as the data grows.

**key api endpoints**
- **New:**
  - : Engages the tactical buying team for a specific quotation.
  - : Fetches all sourcing requests for the current user with tracking data.
  - : Fetches aggregate stats for the buying desk dashboard.
- **Existing:**
  - 
  - 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority #1 is fixing the landing page translation.** The user has reported this twice. All the backend data (translation keys) is ready in ; you just need to finish wiring it up in the  component. Do not move on to other tasks until the landing page is fully and correctly translated in all 5 languages.
- The user is very detail-oriented about UI/UX. Pay close attention to branding, logos, and text labels.
- A new feature, the Buying Desk Dashboard, is now live. It relies on new fields (, ) in the  MongoDB collection. The agent has already run a migration script to update existing records.
- All logo and branding changes requested by the user have been completed.
