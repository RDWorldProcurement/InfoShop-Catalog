**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** The frontend UI is inconsistent.  uses a new design while other pages (, , etc.) are still on the old design. The multi-language system is in place but not yet used by a UI switcher or across all components.
*   **Mocked:** Product and Service data is still largely placeholder text. It lacks the real-world images, descriptions, and specifications requested by the user. The PunchOut functionality is a simulation.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Emergent LLM Key:** Mentioned for a potential chatbot (InfoConnect), but the chatbot is currently just a placeholder UI element. No active integration.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (twice in previous iterations)
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None.
  - Known regressions: The UI is in a state of flux and broken by design, as a redesign is in progress.
